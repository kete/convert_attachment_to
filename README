ConvertAttachmentTo
===================

Written for New Zealand Registry Services as an extention of the Kete software (an open source Rails application for collaborative digital archives) by Walter McGinnis for Katipo Communications, Ltd. (http://katipo.co.nz/).

The general idea is to take uploaded documents, PDF, MS Word, HTML, or
Plain Text  to start, and convert them to either plain text or HTML (sans html, head, title, body tags), depending on settings, and stick the value in the specified attribute of the model.

Note that the MS Word support hasn't been tested with newer versionsof MS Word format.  It may not work.

=========
Requirements:

Currently this plugin handles, MS Word documents, PDFs, HTML, and plain text uploads.  It may have other content types added in the future. Look for acceptable_content_types in the code for an indication.

This plugin requires that these external command line programs be installed as it is mainly a wrapper for these programs.  These are:

* pdftohtml

* pdftotext

* wv (not wv2)
  Debian (or Ubuntu)
  sudo apt-get install wv

  Mac OS X:
  http://wvware.sourceforge.net/wvWare.html if you installed
  ImageMagick from source (probably wise) rather than MacPorts, install from source
  otherwise "sudo port install wv"

* lynx for html to plain text

* RedCloth ruby gem

Important: This means that ConvertAttachmentTo isn't compatible with Windows systems.

It also assumes that you are using the attachment_fu plugin to manage your model's file uploads.

Optional, for testing:

sqlite

=======
Installation:

After installing the required software.  Install convert_attachment_to as you would any other plugin.  This can take many forms, depending on your version control system and stategy for managing external dependencies.  If you are simply "playing" the plugin to see if you
want to use it, this will do the trick:

script/plugin install http://svn.kete.net.nz/projects/convert_attachment_to/trunk
mv vendor/plugins/trunk vendor/plugins/convert_attachment_to

Recommended:

Before starting to use convert_attachment_to, I suggest that you should run its tests to make sure all the required software is installed and being found by your application, etc. You will need sqlite installed for testing to work.  Here's how:

rake test:plugins PLUGIN=convert_attachment_to # from your apps rails root
rm convert_attachment_to_plugin.sqlite.db # toss the db, after each test run

====
Usage:

In your model that uses "has_attachments", i.e. attachment_fu, specify the output mime type and the attribute of the model that should be populated with it.

convert_attachment_to :html, :description

At this stage, you may only choose to convert to HTML or plain text,
i.e.
convert_attachment_to :html, :some_attribute
or
convert_attachment_to :text, :some_attribute

Cheers,
